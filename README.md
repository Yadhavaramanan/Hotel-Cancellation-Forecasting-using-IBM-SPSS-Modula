#  Predictive Modeling Analysis: Hotel Booking Cancellation Forecast
 
 ##  Project Overview
 This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using machine learning models built with **IBM SPSS Modeler**. By analyzing customer behavior and booking details, the model helps hotels make informed decisions to improve operational efficiency and reduce revenue loss due to cancellations.

 ## Results
 - **Best Model**: Decision Tree
 - **Accuracy**: ~[Insert your accuracy here]%
 - **Insights**:
   - High lead time and non-refundable deposits increase cancellation probability
   - Repeat guests are less likely to cancel
